# Dotfiles
@dblancorojas dotfiles.

Keep in mind that my current work environment is Arch linux so I might have 
files with settings specific to Arch.

Clone to `$HOME/.dotfiles` directory like this:

```
> cd $HOME
> git clone git@github.com:DanielBlanco/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

## Install
Run the install script:
```
> cd $HOME
> .dotfiles/install.sh
```
